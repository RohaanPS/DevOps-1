Kubernetes
  Kubernetes was donated to the cloud native computing foundation,a neutral home for open source cloud native project in 2015.
Google started developing a system called to manage their internal containerized applications.
Borg enabled google to run application at scale , providing automatic scalling features.

Kubernetes, often shortened to K8s, 
is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Key Features:
 Container Orchestration
 Automation
 Scalability
 Open Source 

Benefits of Using Kubernetes
 Simplified Deployment and Management
 Increased Agility
 Improved Reliability

 Master node 
 This node is responsible for managing cluster
Control manager 
 this controller manager runs various controllers that monitor the cluster state and drive it towards the derived state.
 API - cluster connectivity
Scheduler - is assigning work flow
etcd: etcd is distributed key-value store used by kubernetes to store cluster state and configuration data.

pods : are basic units of Kubernetes.

replica sset: it ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times.

Deployment: A higher-level abstraction that manages and update a set of replica pods.

Service: A service provides a stable network endpoint for accessing a group of pods.
